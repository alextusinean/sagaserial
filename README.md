Activation key generator for [SAGA 3.0.XXX accountancy software](https://www.sagasoft.ro/) (B, C, P.S.)

This started as and is a project for educational purposes in order to discover the software's inner workings regarding activation, hence the replacement of the actual generation code with a stub [sagaserial.h#264](https://github.com/alextusinean/sagaserial/blob/master/sagaserial.h#L264). I made this public for people that already know the generation algorithm (or maybe those who want to find it) so they don't have to spend time on making an UI. If you know how to build this, you should also know how to find the algorithm in the software. I may be able to help if needed.

Come on, it's FoxPro!
